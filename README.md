# Subscription-Based-Streaming-Service_-project

This project focuses on developing a command-line streaming platform that simulates the core functionalities of modern OTT services. The system allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and choose from multiple subscription plans based on their preferences. Each plan provides access to a curated set of content, and users can browse, search, and stream items available under their subscription tier.
